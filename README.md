## My process
Really easy challange, putting everything together into containers makes it easy to create padding and spacing. Positioning it with flexbox inside a 100vh x 100% container makes it always centered, and using em values as padding/margin feels way more reliable.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Feeling more comfortable with using flexbox and relative values for padding/margin. A lot cleaner than the first challange i did here.

### Useful resources
